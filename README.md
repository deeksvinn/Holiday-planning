# Holiday-planning
# This is one of the first tasks using functions in my Hyperiondev bootcamp.
# This python program calculates the user's costs involved in going on a holiday to any of the three city options.
# Program shows usage of functions to calculate different costs involved 
# a function is used to calculate the cost of plane tickets
# a function is used to calculate the hotel cost depending on the number of days planned to stay
# a function is used to calculate the cost of car rental depending on the number of day for rental
